# React Social App (Udemy Course Project)

This is a full-stack React project built as part of the [React For The Rest Of Us](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-for-the-rest-of-us) course by Brad Schiff. The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience building a modern, production-style React application from scratch â€” including both the client-side SPA and a custom Node/Express API backend.
